# Public Vault
This is my public Obsidian Vault. Everything in here is non-confidential and is stored publicly.

## Folder Structure

A folder for containing my projects. All projects have subfolders, and may be grouped via a related topic - such as AT Proto.

### /dailynotes
My daily notes directory. Contains an assortment of notes depending on the day I wrote them.

### /templates
Template files for my different folders/projects/etc 

### /attachments 
Just a folder for holding all non-markdown attachments referenced in files.
