Setting up my obsidian vault, I want an atproto directory, for all my projects - currently mainly just the scheduling assistant!. Im putting this into a subfolder of a larger project directory, which will hopefully have other things in it in the future - like a personal website, lol.

I should create some templates for basic documents, like daily notes, quick notes, etc. Good way to randomly and haphazardly organise my thoughts - I need to do a better job of keeping together everything I'm working on, and have previously worked on.

Some things to note for a daily note template:
- Section for random thoughts
- Section for job applications 
- Section for daily goals/work done (?)
It doesn't need to perfect on a first go, but I should try to make one before tomorrow. And I can refine it as I find it useful/useless.

I should make it a goal to make at least one daily note just to hold myself accountable to my project goals, though.

Random thought in spite of not having a section for it in this document yet: could i do vault syncing over atproto? In particular, using a PDS as a central store for vault information. The vault could live on the PDS as an encrypted item, and then the hosts could have private keys to decrypt (?).
