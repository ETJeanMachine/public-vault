Thinking back on my website work, I'm thinking now I should figure out a more complex style earlier on. I think this is good for multiple reasons:
- It makes the finished product look better (it's kinda medicore right now).
- It it's easier to develop new pages with pre-built components.
I am thinking about making the background blurred anime footage, but I think it'll be valuable to ONLY have this on the home page - and make a smooth transition to a more plain background on other pages. I think it'd be incredibly distracting to read say, blog posts, with an animated background. Additionally, I should consider adding a "[[recommendations]]" page in the long term - just things I like/reccomend people use. I should create a note for this in my project directory in obsidian.

Movie to check out now that I saw it: Potato Dreams of America
