Today I think I'll work on improving my svelte skills. I'm setting up a svelte repo locally for my personal website (jeanmachine.dev), and I'd like to actually be able to have a real portfolio website soon. Not having one right now isn't super great!

I have previously worked a bit through the svelte docs and found them quite nice to work with, so I'll probably return to that today as well. But I'd like to (at minimum) produce a homepage for my website. I'm also going to make an Obsidian folder in the [[projects/atproto/README|project directory]] here to try and organise my [[thoughts|thoughts and ideas]] around the website. Other than that, I think that's going to remain to be my main goal for the day.

Also - holy cannoli, MacOS Tahoe Developer Beta 1 right now is so slow on my M1 Pro laptop. Everything's lagging! Not super great, but that's what I get for early-upgrading my system way before I should have in the middle of a developer beta.
