Working on my personal website, noting a few things:
- I think material design is overkill for the aesthetic I'm going for - I can accomplish much of what I want with basic CSS. It's also grossly slow in loading.
- I think my basic homepage layout should be something like:
  ((INFO / LINKS) (AVATAR)) (ABOUT | ((LATEST POST) (RECENT COMMITS)))
	- Basic, informational, not too in the way. I think it probably works okay like this. () is next to eachother, | is above. Not sure entirely on how to lay this out, but will work on it throughout today!
