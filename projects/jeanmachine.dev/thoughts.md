Messing around with SvelteKit today, got some basic things set up, still needs a lot of work. The goals here:
- An actually decent design. Maybe look at Material 3 Expressive to see if there's any tools for that for web dev, or even liquid glass (i don't think this is easy so I should stay away).
- What kinda background should it have? Potentially a blurred background with mp4's playing in the background, but this sounds potentially expensive. Should look into this.
- Three pages for now - Home, Projects, and Blog. 
	- Eventually, hook up blog to some kinda atproto service. either whitewind or leaflet - but probably the latter, as it seems more actively maintained.
Svelte is much easier than react so far, which is great for me, though.
